### Introduction

Bloggios' frontend application is developed using React JS, specifically created with Create React App (CRA), alongside
essential dependencies such as Redux Toolkit and React Query. Despite being in its nascent stage, the project commenced
in May and is progressively evolving. This repository encompasses the comprehensive end-to-end codebase of the Bloggios
Application's frontend, inclusive of its admin panel functionality. For the backend infrastructure, corresponding
components are distributed across separate repositories. The authentication mechanism is housed within the "auth-server"
repository, while the API gateway, responsible for routing requests to designated microservices, resides in "
bloggios-cloud-gateway". Additionally, functionalities related to email notifications and other email-related tasks are
managed within a dedicated "email service" repository.
